abstract = {This review highlights recent developments and future perspectives in carbon dioxide usage for the sustainable production of energy and chemicals and to reduce global warming. We discuss the heterogeneously catalysed hydrogenation, as well as the photocatalytic and electrocatalytic conversion of CO2 to hydrocarbons or oxygenates. Various sources of hydrogen are also reviewed in terms of their CO2 neutrality. Technologies have been developed for large-scale CO2 hydrogenation to methanol or methane. Their industrial application is, however, limited by the high price of renewable hydrogen and the availability of large-volume sources of pure CO2. With regard to the direct electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to value-added chemicals, substantial advances in electrodes, electrolyte, and reactor design are still required to permit the development of commercial processes. Therefore, in this review particular attention is paid to (i) the design of metal electrodes to improve their performance and (ii) recent developments of alternative approaches such as the application of ionic liquids as electrolytes and of microorganisms as co-catalysts. The most significant improvements both in catalyst and reactor design are needed for the photocatalytic functionalisation of CO2 to become a viable technology that can help in the usage of CO2 as a feedstock for the production of energy and chemicals. Apart from technological aspects and catalytic performance, we also discuss fundamental strategies for the rational design of materials for effective transformations of CO2 to value-added chemicals with the help of H2, electricity and/or light.},

abstract = {The purpose of fertilisation is the optimisation of plant nutrition and the maintenance of the fertility of soils. Whilst they are essential to plant nutrition, fertilisers nevertheless make a substantial contribution to the environmental footprint of crop production. Accordingly, the optimisation of fertilisation performance is both a key issue and a lever for environmental improvement. While good nitrogen fertilisation is already well-known and familiar to farmers, environmental differentiation between the main forms of nitrogen fertiliser is a lever for improvement which has yet to be analysed. GPN and InVivo AgroSolutions therefore decided to work on a comparative Life Cycle Analysis of the three main forms of fertiliser used in France, in order to obtain a reliable and objective comparison of their respective environmental impacts on large-scale crop cultivation. This analysis has been validated by a critical review, which was conducted by in-house experts from both companies and supervised by the BioIntelligence Service. The conclusions of this analysis reflect the superior environmental performance of ammonium nitrate produced within the European Union, in comparison with urea or nitrogen solution of non-European origin, in terms of all calculated indicators. In the interests of clarity, only the three of these indicators (potential contribution to climate change, consumption of non-renewable primary energy, potential for acidification) have been considered for communication purposes, while the remaining indicators will provide a means of guarding against any transfers of pollution. The superiority of ammonium nitrate can be explained by the following: ‚Ä¢ optimised industrial processes associated with stronger environmental pressures in Europe; ‚Ä¢ variable emissions of pollutant molecules in the field associated with different chemical composition; ‚Ä¢ differences in agronomic efficiency.},

abstract = {The production of synthetic ammonia remains dependent on the energy- and capital-intensive Haber‚ÄìBosch process. Extensive research in molecular catalysis has demonstrated ammonia production from dinitrogen, albeit at low production rates. Mechanistic understanding of dinitrogen reduction to ammonia continues to be delineated through study of molecular catalyst structure, as well as through understanding the naturally occurring nitrogenase enzyme. The transition to Haber‚ÄìBosch alternatives through robust, heterogeneous catalyst surfaces remains an unsolved research challenge. Catalysts for electrochemical reduction of dinitrogen to ammonia are a specific focus of research, due to the potential to compete with the Haber‚ÄìBosch process and reduce associated carbon dioxide emissions. However, limited progress has been made to date, as most electrocatalyst surfaces lack specificity towards nitrogen fixation. In this Review, we discuss the progress of the field in developing a mechanistic understanding of nitrogenase-promoted and molecular catalyst-promoted ammonia synthesis and provide a review of the state of the art and scientific needs for heterogeneous electrocatalysts.},

@article{Smil_1999_2,
abstract = {Human activities have roughly doubled the amount of reactive N that enters the element's biospheric cycle. Crop production is by far the single largest cause of this anthropogenic alteration. Inorganic fertilizers now provide 80 Tg N yr -1 (Tg = 1012 g), managed (symbiotic) biofixation adds about 20 Tg N yr -1 , and between 28 and 36 Tg N yr -1 are recycled in organic wastes. Anthropogenic inputs (including N in seeds and irrigation water) now supply about 85{\%} of 170 (151-186) Tg N reaching the world's cropland every year. About half of this input, 85 Tg N yr -1 , is taken up by harvested crops and their residues. Quantification of N losses from crop fields is beset by major uncertainties. Losses to the atmosphere (denitrification and volatilization) amount to 26-60 Tg N yr -1 , while waters receive (from leaching and erosion) 32-45 Tg N yr -1 These N losses are the major reason behind the growing concerns about the enrichment of the biosphere with reactive N. The best evidence suggests that in spite of some significant local and regional losses, the world's agricultural land accumulates N. The addition of 3-4 billion people before the year 2050 will require further substantial increases of N input in cropping, but a large share of this demand can come from improved efficiency of N fertilizer use},

Its synthesis from electrochemical reduction of N2 is an attractive alternative to the industrial method that requires high temperature and pressure. Currently, electrochemical N2 fixation suffered from slow kinetics due to the difficulty of N2 adsorption and N‚â°N cleavage. Here, N-doped porous carbon (NPC) was reported as a cost-effective electrocatalyst for ammonia synthesis from electrocatalytic N2 reduction at ambient conditions, where its N content and species were tuned to enhance N2 chemical adsorption and N‚â°N cleavage. The resulted NPC was effective for fixing N2 to ammonia with high ammonia production rate (1.40 mmol g-1 h-1 at -0.9 V vs RHE). Experiments combined with density functional theory calculation revealed pyridinic and pyrrolic N were active sites for ammonia synthesis and their contents were crucial for promoting ammonia production on NPC.

abstract = {We investigate the price and volatility transmission between natural gas, fertilizer (ammonia), and corn markets, an issue that has been traditionally ignored in the literature despite its significant importance. Using a Vector Error Correction Model for the conditional mean equation and a Multivariate Generalized Autoregressive Heteroskedasity model for the conditional volatility equation, we find significant interplay between fertilizer and corn markets, while only a mild linkage in prices and volatility exist between those markets and natural gas during the period 1994-2014. There is not only a positive relationship between corn and ammonia prices in the short-run, but both prices react to deviation from the long-run parity. Furthermore, the lagged conditional volatility of ammonia prices positively affects conditional volatility in the corn market and vice versa. This result is robust to a specification using crude oil price as an alternative to natural gas price to account for the large transportation cost built into ammonia prices. Results for the period of 2006-2014 indicate virtually no linkage between natural gas prices and those of fertilizer and corn during that period, while linkages in price level and volatility between the latter remain strong. This article is the first in the literature to comprehensively examine the role of fertilizer on corn prices and volatility, and its relation to natural gas prices. },

abstract = {Biological dinitrogen (N2) fixation is a natural process of significant importance in world agriculture. The demand for accurate determinations of global inputs of biologically-fixed nitrogen (N) is strong and will continue to be fuelled by the need to understand and effectively manage the global N cycle. In this paper we review and update long-standing and more recent estimates of biological N2 fixation for the different agricultural systems, including the extensive, uncultivated tropical savannas used for grazing. Our methodology was to combine data on the areas and yields of legumes and cereals from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) database on world agricultural production (FAOSTAT) with published and unpublished data on N2 fixation. As the FAO lists grain legumes only, and not forage, fodder and green manure legumes, other literature was accessed to obtain approximate estimates in these cases. Below-ground plant N was factored into the estima- tions. The most important N2-fixing agents in agri- cultural systems are the symbiotic associations between crop and forage/fodder legumes and rhizo- bia. Annual inputs of fixed N are calculated to be 2.95 Tg for the pulses and 18.5 Tg for the oilseed legumes. Soybean (Glycine max) is the dominant crop legume, representing 50{\%} of the global crop legume area and 68{\%} of global production. We calculate soybean to fix 16.4 Tg N annually, representing 77{\%} of the N fixed by the crop legumes. Annual N2 fixation by soybean in the U.S., Brazil and Argentina is calculated at 5.7, 4.6 and 3.4 Tg, respectively. Accurately estimating global N2 fixation for the symbioses of the forage and fodder legumes is challenging because statistics on the areas and productivity of these legumes are almost impossible to obtain. The uncertainty increases as we move to the other agricultural-production systems‚Äîrice (Oryza sativa), sugar cane (Saccharum spp.), cereal and oilseed (non-legume) crop lands and extensive, grazed savannas. Nonetheless, the estimates of annual N2 fixation inputs are 12‚Äì25 Tg (pasture and fodder legumes), 5 Tg (rice), 0.5 Tg (sugar cane), {\textless}4 Tg (non- legume crop lands) and {\textless}14 Tg (extensive savannas). Aggregating these individual estimates provides an overall estimate of 50‚Äì70 Tg N fixed biologically in agricultural systems. The uncertainty of this range would be reduced with the publication of more accurate statistics on areas and productivity of forage and fodder legumes and the publication of many more estimates of N2 fixation, particularly in the cereal, oilseed and non-legume crop lands and extensive tropical savannas used for grazing.},

	abstract = {Models show that to avert dangerous levels of climate change, global carbon dioxide emissions must fall to zero later this century. Most of these emissions arise from energy use. Davis et al. review what it would take to achieve decarbonization of the energy system. Some parts of the energy system are particularly difficult to decarbonize, including aviation, long-distance transport, steel and cement production, and provision of a reliable electricity supply. Current technologies and pathways show promise, but integration of now-discrete energy sectors and industrial processes is vital to achieve minimal emissions.Science, this issue p. eaas9793BACKGROUNDNet emissions of CO2 by human activities{\textemdash}including not only energy services and industrial production but also land use and agriculture{\textemdash}must approach zero in order to stabilize global mean temperature. Energy services such as light-duty transportation, heating, cooling, and lighting may be relatively straightforward to decarbonize by electrifying and generating electricity from variable renewable energy sources (such as wind and solar) and dispatchable ({\textquotedblleft}on-demand{\textquotedblright}) nonrenewable sources (including nuclear energy and fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage). However, other energy services essential to modern civilization entail emissions that are likely to be more difficult to fully eliminate. These difficult-to-decarbonize energy services include aviation, long-distance transport, and shipping; production of carbon-intensive structural materials such as steel and cement; and provision of a reliable electricity supply that meets varying demand. Moreover, demand for such services and products is projected to increase substantially over this century. The long-lived infrastructure built today, for better or worse, will shape the future.Here, we review the special challenges associated with an energy system that does not add any CO2 to the atmosphere (a net-zero emissions energy system). We discuss prominent technological opportunities and barriers for eliminating and/or managing emissions related to the difficult-to-decarbonize services; pitfalls in which near-term actions may make it more difficult or costly to achieve the net-zero emissions goal; and critical areas for research, development, demonstration, and deployment. It may take decades to research, develop, and deploy these new technologies.ADVANCESA successful transition to a future net-zero emissions energy system is likely to depend on vast amounts of inexpensive, emissions-free electricity; mechanisms to quickly and cheaply balance large and uncertain time-varying differences between demand and electricity generation; electrified substitutes for most fuel-using devices; alternative materials and manufacturing processes for structural materials; and carbon-neutral fuels for the parts of the economy that are not easily electrified. Recycling and removal of carbon from the atmosphere (carbon management) is also likely to be an important activity of any net-zero emissions energy system. The specific technologies that will be favored in future marketplaces are largely uncertain, but only a finite number of technology choices exist today for each functional role. To take appropriate actions in the near term, it is imperative to clearly identify desired end points. To achieve a robust, reliable, and affordable net-zero emissions energy system later this century, efforts to research, develop, demonstrate, and deploy those candidate technologies must start now.OUTLOOKCombinations of known technologies could eliminate emissions related to all essential energy services and processes, but substantial increases in costs are an immediate barrier to avoiding emissions in each category. In some cases, innovation and deployment can be expected to reduce costs and create new options. More rapid changes may depend on coordinating operations across energy and industry sectors, which could help boost utilization rates of capital-intensive assets, but this will require overcoming institutional and organizational challenges in order to create new markets and ensure cooperation among regulators and disparate, risk-averse businesses. Two parallel and broad streams of research and development could prove useful: research in technologies and approaches that can decarbonize provision of the most difficult-to-decarbonize energy services, and research in systems integration that would allow reliable and cost-effective provision of these services.A shower of molten metal in a steel foundry.Industrial processes such as steelmaking will be particularly challenging to decarbonize. Meeting future demand for such difficult-to-decarbonize energy services and industrial products without adding CO2 to the atmosphere may depend on technological cost reductions via research and innovation, as well as coordinated deployment and integration of operations across currently discrete energy industries.Some energy services and industrial processes{\textemdash}such as long-distance freight transport, air travel, highly reliable electricity, and steel and cement manufacturing{\textemdash}are particularly difficult to provide without adding carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere. Rapidly growing demand for these services, combined with long lead times for technology development and long lifetimes of energy infrastructure, make decarbonization of these services both essential and urgent. We examine barriers and opportunities associated with these difficult-to-decarbonize services and processes, including possible technological solutions and research and development priorities. A range of existing technologies could meet future demands for these services and processes without net addition of CO2 to the atmosphere, but their use may depend on a combination of cost reductions via research and innovation, as well as coordinated deployment and integration of operations across currently discrete energy industries.},

abstract = {‚Ä¢ Biochar application reduced runoff production relative to soil without biochar. ‚Ä¢ N3{\%} biochar addition accelerated soil loss relative to soil without biochar. ‚Ä¢ The effect of the biochar addition rate on runoff and sediment stronger than particle size ‚Ä¢ Reasonable addition of the biochar rate and particle size could control soil erosion. Editor: Baoliang Chen Increasing literature suggests that biochar can be used to improve soil fertility and subsequently benefit crop yield. However, the effects of biochar application rates and particle sizes on soil erosion processes have yet to be fully identified. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the influence of biochar with different application rates and particle sizes on soil erosion. Addition of biochar to loess generally increased the mean time to runoff by 19.47{\%} relative to the control. The time to runoff decreased with an increase in the biochar application rates and fluctuated with a decrease in biochar particle sizes. The combined 1{\%} and b0.25 mm biochar treatment yielded the longest time to runoff (2.97 min) and the lowest runoff (36.23 kg m ‚àí2 h ‚àí1) and soil loss (1.33 kg m ‚àí2 min ‚àí1). Biochar addition decreased the total runoff volume by 12.21{\%} and generally inhibited soil loss under lower application rates (1{\%} and 3{\%}) while promoting soil loss under higher application rates (5{\%} and 7{\%}). With a decrease in biochar particle size, total runoff volume increased under the 5{\%} and 7{\%} biochar, but no uniform trend was observed under the 1{\%} and 3{\%} biochar treatments. The total soil loss increased with increasing biochar application rates, whereas a negative trend was observed with decreasing biochar particle sizes. The contribution of biochar application rates to runoff and soil loss rates was distinctly greater than the bio-char particle sizes. Additionally, biochar addition could increase N2 mm water-stable soil aggregates and saturated hydraulic conductivity (K sat) in this study. We inferred that the positive effects on soil and water loss were potentially due to the improvement in N2 mm water-stable soil aggregates and K sat. The results implied that soil-biochar additions could be a potential measure for conserving soil and water in the Loess Plateau.},

abstract = {A review. Rapid turnover of org. matter leads to a low efficiency of org. fertilizers applied to increase and sequester C in soils of the humid tropics. Charcoal was reported to be responsible for high soil org. matter contents and soil fertility of anthropogenic soils (Terra Preta) found in central Amazonia. Therefore, the authors reviewed the available information about the phys. and chem. properties of charcoal as affected by different combustion procedures, and the effects of its application in agricultural fields on nutrient retention and crop prodn. Higher nutrient retention and nutrient availability were found after charcoal addns. to soil, related to higher exchange capacity, surface area and direct nutrient addns. Higher charring temps. generally improved exchange properties and surface area of the charcoal. Addnl., charcoal is relatively recalcitrant and can therefore be used as a long-term sink for atm. CO2. Several aspects of a charcoal management system remain unclear, such as the role of microorganisms in oxidizing charcoal surfaces and releasing nutrients and the possibilities to improve charcoal properties during prodn. under field conditions. Several research needs were identified, such as field testing of charcoal prodn. in tropical agroecosystems, the investigation of surface properties of the carbonized materials in the soil environment, and the evaluation of the agronomic and economic effectiveness of soil management with charcoal.

abstract = {At best, common renewable energy strategies can only offset fossil fuel emissions of CO2 - they cannot reverse climate change. One promising approach to lowering CO2 in the atmosphere while producing energy is biochar bio-energy, based on low-temperature pyrolysis. This technology relies on capturing the off-gases from thermal decomposition of wood or grasses to produce heat, electricity, or biofuels. Biochar is a major by-product of this pyrolysis, and has remarkable environmental properties. In soil, biochar was shown to persist longer and to retain cations better than other forms of soil organic matter. The precise half life of biochar is still disputed, however, and this will have important implications for the value of the tech nology, particularly in carbon trading. Furthermore, the cation retention of fresh biochar is relatively low compared to aged biochar in soil, and it is not clear under what conditions, and over what period of time, biochar develops its adsorbing properties. Research is still needed to maximize the favorable attributes of biochar and to fully evaluate environmental risks, but this technology has the potential to provide an important carbon sink and to reduce environmental pollution by fertilizers.},

abstract = {Reducing the vulnerability of agriculture to climate change while increasing primary productivity requires mitigation and adaptation activities to generate profitable co-benefits to farms. The conversion of woody-wastes by pyrolysis to produce bio-char (biologically derived charcoal) is one potential option that can enhance natural rates of carbon sequestration in soils, reduce farm waste, and substitute renewable energy sources for fossil-derived fuel inputs. Bio-char has the potential to increase conventional agricultural productivity and enhance the ability of farmers to participate in carbon markets beyond traditional approach by directly applying carbon into soil. This paper provides an overview of the pyrolysis process and products and quantifies the amount of renewable energy generation and net carbon sequestration possible when using farm bio-waste to produce bio-char as a primary product. While this research provides approximate bio-char and energy production yields, costs, uses and risks, there is a need for additional research on the value of bio-char in conventional crop yields and adaptation and mitigation options. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The formation of dead zones has been exacerbated by the increase in primary production and consequent worldwide coastal eutrophication fueled by riverine runoff of fertilizers and the burning of fossil fuels. Enhanced primary production results in an accumulation of particulate organic matter, which encourages microbial activity and the consumption of dissolved oxygen in bottom waters. Dead zones have now been reported from more than 400 systems, affecting a total area of more than 245,000 square kilometers, and are probably a key stressor on marine ecosystems.},

In particular, we consider the carbon emissions avoided when biochar is applied to agricultural soil, instead of agricultural lime, the amount of carbon sequestered, and the value of carbon offsets, assuming there is an established carbon trading mechanism for biochar soil application. We use winter wheat production in Eastern Whitman County, Washington as a case study, and consider different carbon offset price scenarios and different prices of biochar to estimate a farm profit. Our findings suggest that it may be profitable to apply biochar as a soil amendment under some conditions if the biochar market price is low enough and/or a carbon offset market exists. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Trees were maintained at similar water potentials following irrigation by adjusting water applications as needed. Tree size and fruit number were normalized among treatments by pruning and thinning each season. Surface and subsurface drip produced the largest fruit on average and the highest marketable yields among treatments. Drip benefits appeared most related to the ability to apply frequent irrigations. Whether water was applied above or below ground, daily irrigations by drip maintained higher soil water content within the root zone and prevented cycles of water stress found between less-frequent furrow and microspray irrigations. With furrow and microsprays, midday tree water potentials reached as low as ‚Äì1.4 {\{}MPa{\}} between weekly irrigations and ‚Äì1.8 {\{}MPa{\}} between biweekly irrigations, which likely accounted for smaller fruit and lower yields in these treatments. To reduce water stress, more frequent irrigation is probably impractical with furrow systems but is recommended when irrigating during peak water demands by microspray.},

Field experiments were conducted from 2011‚Äì2013 at three different sites, including Honghu, Shayang, and Jingzhou in China, to determine the effects of fertilization on enhancing crop productivity and indigenous nutrient-supplying capacity (INuS) in a rice (Oryza sativa L.)-rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) rotation. Four mineral fertilizer treatments (NPK, NP, NK and PK) were applied in a randomized complete block design with three replicates. Crop yields were increased by 19‚Äì41{\%} (rice) and 61‚Äì76{\%} (rapeseed) during the two years of rice-rapeseed rotation under NPK fertilization compared to PK fertilization across the study sites. Yield responses to fertilization were ranked NPK‚Äâ{\textgreater}‚ÄâNP‚Äâ{\textgreater}‚ÄâNK‚Äâ{\textgreater}‚ÄâPK, illustrating that N deficiency was the most limiting condition in a rice-rapeseed rotation, followed by P and K deficiencies. The highest and lowest N, P and K accumulations were observed under NPK and PK fertilization, respectively. The INuS of the soil decreased to a significant extent and affected rice-rapeseed rotation productivity at each site under NP, NK, and PK fertilization when compared to NPK. Based on the study results, a balanced nutrient application using NPK fertilization is a key management strategy for enhancing rice-rapeseed productivity and environmental safety.},

abstract = {The impact of soil nutrient depletion on crop production has been known for decades, but robust assessments of the impact of increasingly unbalanced nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) application rates on crop production are lacking. Here, we use crop response functions based on 741 FAO maize crop trials and EPIC crop modeling across Africa to examine maize yield deficits resulting from unbalanced N : P applications under low, medium, and high input scenarios, for past (1975), current, and future N : P mass ratios of respectively, 1 : 0.29, 1 : 0.15, and 1 : 0.05. At low N inputs (10 kg ha(-1)), current yield deficits amount to 10{\%} but will increase up to 27{\%} under the assumed future N : P ratio, while at medium N inputs (50 kg N ha(-1)), future yield losses could amount to over 40{\%}. The EPIC crop model was then used to simulate maize yields across Africa. The model results showed relative median future yield reductions at low N inputs of 40{\%}, and 50{\%} at medium and high inputs, albeit with large spatial variability. Dominant low-quality soils such as Ferralsols, which are strongly adsorbing P, and Arenosols with a low nutrient retention capacity, are associated with a strong yield decline, although Arenosols show very variable crop yield losses at low inputs. Optimal N : P ratios, i.e. those where the lowest amount of applied P produces the highest yield (given N input) where calculated with EPIC to be as low as 1 : 0.5. Finally, we estimated the additional P required given current N inputs, and given N inputs that would allow Africa to close yield gaps (ca. 70{\%}). At current N inputs, P consumption would have to increase 2.3-fold to be optimal, and to increase 11.7-fold to close yield gaps. The P demand to overcome these yield deficits would provide a significant additional pressure on current global extraction of P resources.},

abstract = {The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) faces possibly the most daunting infrastructure challenge on the African continent. Conflict has seriously damaged most infrastructure networks. Vast geography, low population density, extensive forestlands, and criss-crossing rivers complicate the development of new networks. Progress has been made since the return of peace in 2003. A privately funded GSM network now provides mobile telephone signals to two-thirds of the population. External funding has been secured to rebuild the country's road network, and domestic air traffic has grown. Modest investments could harness inland waterways for low-cost transport. Much more substantial investments in hydropower would enable the DRC to meet its own energy demands cheaply while exporting vast quantities of power. One of the country's most immediate infrastructure challenges is to reform the national power utility and increase power generation and delivery. Capacity must increase by 35 percent over the period 2006-15 to meet domestic demand. The dilapidated condition of both road and rail infrastructure presents another challenge. To meet the target defined in the report, investment in the country's infrastructure must increase from $700 million to $5.3 billion per year over the next decade, a staggering 75 percent of 2006 GDP. New infrastructure technologies, the elimination of inefficiencies, and cross-border finance (for hydropower development) could cut the annual funding gap in half. Recently, the country secured \$4 billion in external finance commitments for infrastructure, enabling increases in budget allocations for public investment.},
